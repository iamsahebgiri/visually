# Bubble sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as _sinking sort_, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Donald Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming, concluded that

> The bubble sort seems to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical problems.

## Performance

| Cases            | Performance |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Worst case       | $O(n^2)$    |
| Average case     | $O(n^2)$    |
| Best case        | $O(n)$      |
| Space complexity | $O(1)$      |
| Stable           | Yes         |

## Pseudocode

```py
do
  swapped = false
  for i = 1 to indexOfLastUnsortedElement-1

    if leftElement > rightElement
      swap(leftElement, rightElement)
      swapped = true; 
      ++swapCounter;

while swapped

```
